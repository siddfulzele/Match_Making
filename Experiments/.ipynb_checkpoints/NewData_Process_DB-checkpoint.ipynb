       "1998  i've spent the last 10 years working in the outdoor industry, mainly devoting all my time to climbing. its been awesome, great people, cool places, fun times. recently i have been trying to branch back out into the sports i loved growing up and diversify my outdoor time again. snowboarding, biking, running, etc. i don't usually just sit around. i like working with my hands and building things, mainly small home projects to improve the place i live. current project is trying to make a big garden in the backyard, but its a work in progress so it will be awhile before we see if i have a green thumb or not. i volunteer with a high school youth program called youth & government and besides being fun the kids are a constant source of entertainment. i also love dogs, but travel to much to have one and although i eat healthy i could eat pizza for every meal if it needed to be done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1999  i am that i am.  more and more, my spiritual life is being in and with whatever is going on with acceptance. i feel my experience as fully as possible and am finding more space for both light and shadow to hang out together. i'm also a personal growth junkie.  i am part cat, part tree, all human.  touch, cuddling, and sexuality nourish me deeply. i am comfortable and enjoy an abundance of all three. at the same time, i seek true intimacy, which i've found requires accepting all of oneself and another, boundaries and all.  i was born in the high desert. while i still have much affinity for places where the soul can go unbound, i like to have more green around and to grow things without feeling like i'm killing the water table.  a good friend once told me that i ask a lot from life. i live deeply.  i've spent a year hiking with teenagers in the utah desert. i lived for two years in malawi, africa working with subsistence farmers. i was a permaculture teacher at a raw food welness center. i've been around the world.  i'm a twin.  i can sometimes come across more as a friend than a romantic interest at first. it's just my way of being shy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "1998  i've spent the last 10 years working in the outdoor industry, mainly devoting all my time to climbing. its been awesome, great people, cool places, fun times. recently i have been trying to branch back out into the sports i loved growing up and diversify my outdoor time again. snowboarding, biking, running, etc. i don't usually just sit around. i like working with my hands and building things, mainly small home projects to improve the place i live. current project is trying to make a big garden in the backyard, but its a work in progress so it will be awhile before we see if i have a green thumb or not. i volunteer with a high school youth program called youth & government and besides being fun the kids are a constant source of entertainment. i also love dogs, but travel to much to have one and although i eat healthy i could eat pizza for every meal if it needed to be done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "1999  i am that i am.  more and more, my spiritual life is being in and with whatever is going on with acceptance. i feel my experience as fully as possible and am finding more space for both light and shadow to hang out together. i'm also a personal growth junkie.  i am part cat, part tree, all human.  touch, cuddling, and sexuality nourish me deeply. i am comfortable and enjoy an abundance of all three. at the same time, i seek true intimacy, which i've found requires accepting all of oneself and another, boundaries and all.  i was born in the high desert. while i still have much affinity for places where the soul can go unbound, i like to have more green around and to grow things without feeling like i'm killing the water table.  a good friend once told me that i ask a lot from life. i live deeply.  i've spent a year hiking with teenagers in the utah desert. i lived for two years in malawi, africa working with subsistence farmers. i was a permaculture teacher at a raw food welness center. i've been around the world.  i'm a twin.  i can sometimes come across more as a friend than a romantic interest at first. it's just my way of being shy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
