       "1998  i've spent the last 10 years working in the outdoor industry, mainly devoting all my time to climbing. its been awesome, great people, cool places, fun times. recently i have been trying to branch back out into the sports i loved growing up and diversify my outdoor time again. snowboarding, biking, running, etc. i don't usually just sit around. i like working with my hands and building things, mainly small home projects to improve the place i live. current project is trying to make a big garden in the backyard, but its a work in progress so it will be awhile before we see if i have a green thumb or not. i volunteer with a high school youth program called youth & government and besides being fun the kids are a constant source of entertainment. i also love dogs, but travel to much to have one and although i eat healthy i could eat pizza for every meal if it needed to be done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "27    currently trying to figure out where to go and what to see for the fourth. yay for being new around here?  after trying a few times to start out this 'summary' with something other than a cliche, let's go with this: - i consider my weeks penance for my weekends. - the moment i get off of work on friday, i turn the music up in my mini, and rock out until i'm in the best mood i can be in. - some days i feel cuter than others, and i'm pretty sure that's normal. - tardiness is my biggest pet peeve. - i've been applauded for pronouncing 'niche' correctly in a presentation. - my hair is usually boring-brown, but i've recently-ish decided that dark red with highlights is my preferred color. - i'm rarely around on weekends; if i don't have something to do, or somewhere to explore, i get melancholy. - i've recently learned that i like shooting guns. and that i'm a decent shot. next on the list is to see how awesome an archer i am.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "1891  first off let me say this i am not your average chick. i don't like pink. i am a t shirt and jeans girl. i will only wear a dress for the right person at the right time. im not a fan of shopping. i do love to browse but if i don't really need it i won't buy it. books and music that a totally different story if i like it and i don't have it i will most likely buy it. i don't mind going to sci-fi anime or comic conventions to me they're actually quite fun but ill be honest i know very little about the subjects listed above. i don't mind video games i just don't play them and prefer they don't become third party. i like going to baseball games(by the way i'm a giants fan). but i don't mind going to a's games(i have family who are a's fans) or even the dodgers (my bff and some of family are fans). i love being able to go and explore different cities. i love food all types and i love trying different foods. i'm a huge fan of food trucks. i love movies of all genres. i love art of all types. i work in retail not because of what i do but because i am a people person and i like making other people happy at my job. something people get surprised about is i don't drive. not because i don't want to but because i haven't needed one until well now. i do go workout 2 to 3 times a week.   \n",
